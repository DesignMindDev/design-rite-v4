## Update for Claude - 2025-10-01

Summary of recent work (for Claude evaluation):

- Hardened Spatial Studio upload route (`app/api/spatial-studio/upload-floorplan/route.ts`):
  - Uses Node Buffer for Supabase uploads.
  - Attempts to create `spatial-floorplans` storage bucket if missing and retries upload once.
  - Wraps Anthropic/OpenAI Vision call in try/catch and falls back to an empty analysis object so uploads still succeed.

- Hardened Spatial Studio analyze route (`app/api/spatial-studio/analyze-site/route.ts`):
  - Added retry with exponential backoff for OpenAI calls.
  - Defensive parse of AI responses; falls back to valid-but-empty analysis on parse failure.
  - Per-item DB insert try/catch for AI suggestions so one bad suggestion doesn't abort the process.

- Tests:
  - Ran `__tests__/api/spatial-studio.test.ts` after changes; Phase 1 tests (upload, analyze, annotate) passed locally.

Key decisions to evaluate:

1. Auto-creating Supabase storage buckets on upload failure (helps first-time setup/tests but may be undesirable in strict infra).
2. Falling back to an empty analysis when AI fails to parse or rejects the image — improves availability but may mask analytic failures.
3. Uniformizing AI error handling could be improved by centralizing Anthropic/OpenAI client logic.

Requested from Claude:

- Compare the changes above with the recommended refactor plan in `.ai_agents/CLAUDE_REMEDIATION_PROMPT.md` and identify any gaps.
- Advise on whether auto-create bucket behavior should be kept or removed, with short rationale.
- Provide a compact remediation patch (code suggestions) for centralizing Claude client usage and removing acceptance of API keys via request bodies.

Safety & confirmation policy (NEW)

- BEFORE proposing any edits that modify files, you MUST:
  1. Produce a clear, itemized list of files you believe are relevant to the requested change and for each file write one sentence explaining why it is needed.
  2. For any file you think can be removed or is unused, mark it explicitly as "candidate for removal" and explain the reasoning and risk.
  3. Provide an exact, minimal patch (unified diff or clear file edit plan) that you propose applying.
  4. Do NOT attempt to apply or execute the patch. Stop and wait for an explicit approval token.

- APPROVAL TOKEN: To authorize making changes, the human operator must add a single line containing the token APPROVE_CLAUDE_CHANGES to the file `.ai_agents/agent_log.json` (as a new object entry with a timestamp). Only after that token appears may you propose a follow-up message that identifies the exact edits you will execute.

- If you cannot confidently identify the minimal set of files to change, list the information you need (missing environment variables, which Supabase tables are present, migration status, etc.) and ask clarifying questions instead of guessing.

Deliverables expected from Claude (when asked for remediation):

- A bullet list: files to change (with one-line justification each).
- A single compact patch (unified diff format) showing only the minimal edits.
- A short test plan describing 2-3 focused tests to validate the change (happy path + 1 failure case).
- Risk assessment: 2 bullet points about possible regressions and how to mitigate.

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Automatically accepting or using API keys provided in HTTP request bodies.
- Deleting files or running migrations without explicit human confirmation and the approval token.

Artifacts:

Artifacts:

- Test run: `__tests__/api/spatial-studio.test.ts` — PASS (3 tests)
- Files changed: `app/api/spatial-studio/upload-floorplan/route.ts`, `app/api/spatial-studio/analyze-site/route.ts`
