### SQL Queries for Analytics
```sql
-- Count leads by offer type
SELECT offer_choice, COUNT(*) as count
FROM challenge_leads
GROUP BY offer_choice;

-- Conversion rate for free trial
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_leads,
  SUM(CASE WHEN email_verified THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as verified_count,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN email_verified THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::numeric / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) as conversion_rate
FROM challenge_leads
WHERE offer_choice = '7day-trial';

-- Paid subscription conversion
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_paid_leads,
  SUM(CASE WHEN account_created THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed_payments,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN account_created THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::numeric / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) as payment_conversion_rate
