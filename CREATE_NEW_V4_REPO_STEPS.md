# Steps to Create Fresh V4 Repo and Rename Old Repo

## Step 1: Rename Current GitHub Repo to V3 (Do This First!)

1. Go to: https://github.com/DesignMindDev/design-rite-v4/settings
2. Scroll to "Repository name"
3. Change from: `design-rite-v4`
4. Change to: `design-rite-v3` (or `design-rite-v3-original`)
5. Click "Rename"

**Why first?** GitHub won't let you create a new repo with the same name if the old one still exists.

## Step 2: Create New V4 Repo

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. **Owner:** DesignMindDev
3. **Repository name:** `design-rite-v4` (now available since you renamed the old one)
4. **Description:** Design-Rite v4 - Security Estimation Platform
5. **Visibility:** Private ✅
6. **Initialize:**
   - ❌ Do NOT add README
   - ❌ Do NOT add .gitignore
   - ❌ Do NOT add license
   - (Keep it completely empty!)
7. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 3: Tell Me When Done

After you create the empty repo, come back here and say "repo created" and I'll:

1. Update your local git remote from old repo → new repo
2. Push all branches (main, staging, develop) to the new repo
3. Update Render deployments to use new repo
4. Verify everything is connected properly

## What This Accomplishes

**Before:**
- GitHub repo: design-rite-v4 (was originally v3, renamed)
- Local: C:\Users\dkozi\Projects\design-rite-v4 → points to renamed repo
- Confusing because old v3 code lives in repo named v4

**After:**
- GitHub old repo: design-rite-v3 (renamed back)
- GitHub new repo: design-rite-v4 (fresh start with current working code)
- Local: C:\Users\dkozi\Projects\design-rite-v4 → points to NEW v4 repo
- Clean separation, no confusion!

## Current Code That Will Be Pushed to New Repo

Your local `design-rite-v4` directory has these branches ready to push:

**staging branch (CURRENT WORKING AUTH):**
- Commit 38581bf: Repository setup guide
- Commit 62ae1a1: Auth fix with CASCADE (DEPLOYED and WORKING)
- Commit 950eb22: NextAuth removal
- All the good stuff! ✅

**develop branch:**
- Your development work

**main branch:**
- Production code

All of this will be pushed to the fresh v4 repo.

**Ready? Go create that repo and let me know!**
