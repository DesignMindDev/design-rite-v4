**Code Example:**
```typescript
interface DesignRiteAssessmentData {
  projectName: string;
  siteName: string;
  location: string;
  elementCount: number;
  equipmentCounts: Record<string, number>;
  accessories: SystemSurveyorAccessory[];
  totalValue: number;
  totalLaborHours: number;
  surveyDate: string;
}

export function transformToAssessmentData(
  survey: SystemSurveyorSurvey,
  site: SystemSurveyorSite
): DesignRiteAssessmentData
```

### **API Client Architecture**
Robust client library for System Surveyor integration:

**Core Functions:**
- `validateToken()` - API token authentication
- `getSites()` - User site retrieval
- `getSurveys()` - Site survey listing
- `getSurveyDetails()` - Complete survey data
- `transformToAssessmentData()` - Data conversion
- `generateBOM()` - Bill of materials creation
