## üö® Common Deployment Issues

### Issue: Login Fails with 401

**Fix**:
1. In Render dashboard, click "Clear build cache"
2. Trigger manual deploy
3. If still fails, check `package.json` for missing deps

---

### Issue: Database connection fails
**Cause**: Wrong Supabase keys or network issue

**Fix**:

2. Check `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` is service role (not anon key)
3. Test connection from Supabase dashboard
4. Check Supabase status page for outages

---

### Issue: Environment variables not loading
**Cause**: Typo in variable name or not saved

**Fix**:
1. Go to Render ‚Üí Environment tab
2. Verify all variables are spelled correctly
