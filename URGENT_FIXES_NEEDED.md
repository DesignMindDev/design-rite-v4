# Urgent Fixes Needed - October 18, 2025

## ‚úÖ Issue 1: Duplicate User Detection - FIXED IN CODE

**Problem:** Existing subscribers could still go through Stripe checkout and get stuck.

**Solution:** Added duplicate detection in `/api/leads/create-account`
- Checks Supabase Auth for existing users
- Checks if user has active subscription
- Returns 409 error with friendly message
- Frontend redirects to login automatically

**Status:** Code committed - needs deployment

## ‚úÖ Issue 2: Supabase Email Template - IMPROVED WITH INVITE EMAIL

**Problem:** Email said "Reset Password" instead of welcoming new users

**Solution:** Switched to "Invite User" email template (much better approach!)

### What Changed in Code:

**‚úÖ Updated Files:**
1. `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` - Now uses `inviteUserByEmail()` instead of `resetPasswordForEmail()`
2. `app/api/leads/create-account/route.ts` - Now uses `inviteUserByEmail()` instead of `signInWithOtp()`

**‚úÖ Benefits:**
- More welcoming messaging: "You've been invited to join Design-Rite"
- Better user experience than "reset password" for new signups
- Can include rich onboarding content
- More professional and less confusing

### Manual Setup Required:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - URL: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/aeorianxnxpxveoxzhov
   - Navigate to: **Authentication** ‚Üí **Email Templates**

2. **Select "Invite User" Template** (NOT "Reset Password")

3. **Update with custom template from:**
   - See complete template in: `SUPABASE_INVITE_EMAIL_TEMPLATE.md`
   - Copy and paste the entire HTML template
   - Update subject line: "Welcome to Design-Rite! You've Been Invited üéâ"

4. **Click "Save"**

5. **Test:**
   - Create a new test account (7-day trial or Stripe checkout)
   - Check email - should say "You've been invited to join Design-Rite"

## üî¥ Issue 3: Stripe Webhooks Not Working - CRITICAL

**Problem:** No webhook events received today (Oct 18), last events were Oct 17

**Possible Causes:**
1. Webhook endpoint URL changed
2. Webhook signing secret changed/invalid
3. Render deployment URL changed
4. Webhook was deleted/disabled in Stripe

### Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Check Stripe Webhook Configuration**
   - Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
   - Find webhook endpoint for design-rite.com
   - Check if it's enabled
   - Check endpoint URL (should be: `https://design-rite-v3-zk5r.onrender.com/api/stripe/webhook` or `https://design-rite.com/api/webhooks/stripe`)

2. **Check Webhook Events Listened:**
   Should include:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`

3. **Test Webhook Manually:**
   - In Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks
   - Click on your webhook endpoint
   - Click "Send test webhook"
   - Select `checkout.session.completed`
   - Check if event appears in Render logs

4. **Check Webhook Secret:**
   - In Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Click endpoint
   - Click "Reveal" next to "Signing secret"
   - Compare with environment variable in Render:
     - Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d35mk4bipnbc739je85g/env
     - Find `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
     - Update if they don't match

### Quick Fix if Webhook Doesn't Exist:

Create new webhook in Stripe:
- **Endpoint URL:** `https://design-rite-v3-zk5r.onrender.com/api/stripe/webhook`
- **Events:**
  - checkout.session.completed
  - customer.subscription.created
  - customer.subscription.updated
  - customer.subscription.deleted
  - invoice.payment_succeeded
  - invoice.payment_failed
- **Copy signing secret** and add to Render environment variables as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### Alternative: Check Correct Webhook Route

We have TWO webhook routes:
1. `/api/stripe/webhook` - Older route
2. `/api/webhooks/stripe` - Newer route

Check which one is configured in Stripe and ensure it matches.
