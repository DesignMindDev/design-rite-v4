## üî¥ Issue 3: Stripe Webhooks Not Working - CRITICAL

**Problem:** No webhook events received today (Oct 18), last events were Oct 17

**Possible Causes:**
1. Webhook endpoint URL changed
2. Webhook signing secret changed/invalid
3. Render deployment URL changed
4. Webhook was deleted/disabled in Stripe

### Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Check Stripe Webhook Configuration**
   - Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
   - Find webhook endpoint for design-rite.com
   - Check if it's enabled
   - Check endpoint URL (should be: `https://design-rite-v3-zk5r.onrender.com/api/stripe/webhook` or `https://design-rite.com/api/webhooks/stripe`)

2. **Check Webhook Events Listened:**
   Should include:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`

3. **Test Webhook Manually:**
   - In Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks
   - Click on your webhook endpoint
   - Click "Send test webhook"
   - Select `checkout.session.completed`
   - Check if event appears in Render logs

4. **Check Webhook Secret:**
   - In Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Click endpoint
   - Click "Reveal" next to "Signing secret"
   - Compare with environment variable in Render:
     - Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d35mk4bipnbc739je85g/env
     - Find `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
     - Update if they don't match

### Quick Fix if Webhook Doesn't Exist:

Create new webhook in Stripe:
- **Endpoint URL:** `https://design-rite-v3-zk5r.onrender.com/api/stripe/webhook`
- **Events:**
  - checkout.session.completed
  - customer.subscription.created
  - customer.subscription.updated
  - customer.subscription.deleted
  - invoice.payment_succeeded
  - invoice.payment_failed
- **Copy signing secret** and add to Render environment variables as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### Alternative: Check Correct Webhook Route

We have TWO webhook routes:
1. `/api/stripe/webhook` - Older route
2. `/api/webhooks/stripe` - Newer route

Check which one is configured in Stripe and ensure it matches.
