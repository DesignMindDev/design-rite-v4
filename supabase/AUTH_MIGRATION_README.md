# Auth Migration - Complete Guide

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE AND TESTED
**Project**: design-rite-v4 (Supabase: aeorianxnxpxveoxzhov)

---

## What Was Fixed

### The Problem
- User deletion failed with foreign key constraint errors
- 11 tables had `ON DELETE NO ACTION` blocking deletion
- Mixed old enum types and new text-based roles
- Hours wasted troubleshooting recurring auth issues

### The Solution
- ‚úÖ Created fresh auth schema with CASCADE on ALL tables
- ‚úÖ Fixed 11 blocking foreign key constraints
- ‚úÖ Switched from ENUM to TEXT for flexible role management
- ‚úÖ Proven user deletion works via SQL

---

## SQL Scripts (In Order)

### 1. `COMPLETE_AUTH_SETUP_2025.sql`
**Purpose**: Fresh auth setup for new projects

**What it creates**:
- `profiles` table with CASCADE deletion
- `user_roles` table with TEXT-based roles
- `activity_logs` table with CASCADE deletion
- Trigger functions for auto-profile creation
- Helper functions: `is_admin()`, `is_super_admin()`, `get_user_role()`
- RLS policies for security

**When to use**: Setting up auth from scratch

**Run this if**: Starting a new Supabase project or after nuclear reset

---

### 2. `FIX_ALL_CASCADE.sql`
**Purpose**: Fix existing tables to allow CASCADE deletion

**What it fixes** (11 tables):
- admin_actions_logs
- admin_chat_history
- assessments
- documents
- orchestration_sessions
- pricing_history (SET NULL - preserves history)
- spatial_projects
- super_agent_user_journey
- test_runs (SET NULL - preserves test history)
- test_schedules (SET NULL - preserves schedule history)
- uploaded_documents

**When to use**: Migrating existing database

**Run this if**: You already have tables but user deletion fails

---

### 3. `AUTH_SCHEMA_FRESH_2025.sql`
**Purpose**: Same as COMPLETE_AUTH_SETUP but more detailed

**Use this instead of**: COMPLETE_AUTH_SETUP_2025.sql if you want verbose output

---

### 4. `NUCLEAR_RESET_AUTH_SAFE.sql`
**Purpose**: Delete ONLY auth tables, preserve business data

**When to use**: Starting completely fresh

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: This DELETES all user data! Only use if:
- No production users exist
- You want to start 100% fresh
- You have a backup

---

## Migration Steps (What We Did)

### Step 1: Audit Current State
```sql
-- Found 11 tables blocking deletion with NO ACTION
SELECT * FROM ... -- (diagnostic queries)
```

### Step 2: Fix Constraints
```bash
# Ran FIX_ALL_CASCADE.sql
```

### Step 3: Verify CASCADE Rules
```sql
-- Confirmed all foreign keys now have CASCADE or SET NULL
SELECT * FROM pg_constraint WHERE ...
```

### Step 4: Test Deletion
```sql
-- Created test user
INSERT INTO auth.users ...

-- Deleted successfully
DELETE FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'test@design-rite.com';

-- Verified CASCADE worked
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles WHERE ... -- 0 rows
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_roles WHERE ... -- 0 rows
```

## How to Delete Users

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Supabase Dashboard UI Has a Bug
The dashboard shows "Database error loading user" when trying to delete.

### ‚úÖ Solution: Use SQL Instead
```sql
-- Delete user and CASCADE all related data
DELETE FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';

-- Or by UUID
DELETE FROM auth.users WHERE id = 'uuid-here';
```

### What Gets Deleted (CASCADE)
- ‚úÖ Profile from `profiles`
- ‚úÖ Role from `user_roles`
- ‚úÖ Activity logs from `activity_logs`
- ‚úÖ User assessments from `assessments`
- ‚úÖ User documents from `documents`
- ‚úÖ User projects from `spatial_projects`
- ‚úÖ User uploads from `uploaded_documents`
- ‚úÖ User chat history from `admin_chat_history`
- ‚úÖ Admin action logs from `admin_actions_logs`
- ‚úÖ Orchestration sessions from `orchestration_sessions`
- ‚úÖ Super agent journey from `super_agent_user_journey`

### What Gets Preserved (SET NULL)
- ‚úÖ Pricing history (changed_by ‚Üí NULL)
- ‚úÖ Test runs (triggered_by_user ‚Üí NULL)
- ‚úÖ Test schedules (created_by ‚Üí NULL)

## Role Management

### Old System (ENUM - DON'T USE)
```sql
CREATE TYPE app_role AS ENUM ('admin', 'moderator', 'user');
```
**Problems**: Can't add new roles without migration, inflexible

### New System (TEXT - RECOMMENDED)
```sql
role text CHECK (role IN ('super_admin', 'admin', 'manager', 'user', 'guest'))
```
**Benefits**: Easy to extend, no enum migrations needed

## Testing Checklist

### ‚úÖ Completed Tests
- [x] Fresh schema deployment
- [x] User creation with auto-profile
- [x] Role assignment
- [x] User deletion via SQL
- [x] CASCADE deletion verification
- [x] Profile auto-creation trigger
- [x] RLS policy enforcement

### üî≤ TODO Tests (After This Session)
- [ ] Test signup flow in Next.js app
- [ ] Test login redirect to /estimate-options
- [ ] Test role-based access control
- [ ] Deploy to staging
- [ ] Verify production environment variables

---

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://aeorianxnxpxveoxzhov.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-key

# No NextAuth needed anymore!
```

## Lessons Learned

### ‚ùå What Didn't Work
1. **NextAuth + Supabase hybrid**: Dual session management = chaos
2. **ENUM types**: Too rigid, requires migrations to add roles
3. **Supabase Dashboard user deletion**: UI bug, use SQL instead
4. **Missing CASCADE**: Every hour of troubleshooting traced back to this

### ‚úÖ What Works
1. **Pure Supabase Auth**: Single source of truth
2. **TEXT with CHECK constraint**: Flexible role management
3. **CASCADE on everything**: User deletion just works
4. **SQL over UI**: Direct database access = no surprises

### üéØ Golden Rule
**Always add CASCADE to foreign keys pointing to auth.users!**

```sql
-- ‚úÖ GOOD
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE

-- ‚ùå BAD (default)
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES auth.users(id)
```

## Support

If user deletion fails again:
1. Run diagnostic: `FIND_ALL_USER_REFERENCES.sql` (on Desktop)
2. Look for `‚ö†Ô∏è NO ACTION` or `‚ö†Ô∏è RESTRICT`
3. Add those tables to `FIX_ALL_CASCADE.sql`
4. Re-run the fix script
