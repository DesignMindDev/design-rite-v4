# System Surveyor Excel Import Integration

## Overview

Transform System Surveyor field survey exports into professional Design-Rite security proposals in minutes. No API credentials required - just upload the Excel export and let our AI handle the rest.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Export from System Surveyor**: Export your survey as Excel (.xlsx)
2. **Navigate**: Go to `/integrations/system-surveyor/upload`
3. **Upload**: Drag and drop your Excel file
4. **Process**: Watch as we extract equipment, locations, and labor hours
5. **Generate**: Proceed to AI Assistant for instant proposal generation

## üìä What Gets Imported

### Site Information
- Site name and address
- Survey name and description
- Export date and technician info

### Equipment Categories
- **Cameras**: Type, location, mounting details
- **Network**: Switches, routers, wireless access points
- **Infrastructure**: Cable runs, patch panels, mounting hardware
- **Access Control**: Readers, locks, controllers (if present)
- **Communications**: Phones, speakers, intercoms
- **Audio/Visual**: Monitors, displays, recording equipment

### Labor & Costing
- Installation hours per device
- Cable run labor estimates
- Total labor cost calculation ($85/hr average)
- Equipment quantities and pricing (if included)

## üß† Intelligent Mapping

Our mapper automatically:

### Camera Detection
- **Indoor vs Outdoor**: Analyzes location keywords (lot, corner, exterior ‚Üí outdoor)
- **Camera Type**: Recommends Bullet for outdoor, Turret/Dome for indoor
- **PTZ Detection**: Identifies Pan-Tilt-Zoom from equipment names
- **Resolution**: Detects 4K, 4MP, 1080p specifications

### Network Equipment
- **Switch Sizing**: Estimates port count based on equipment inventory
- **PoE Detection**: Identifies PoE requirements for cameras and APs
- **Wireless**: Maps access points with coverage recommendations

### Infrastructure
- **Cable Runs**: Consolidates individual runs into summary line items
- **Labor Hours**: Captures field-estimated installation times
- **Mounting**: Identifies brackets, poles, conduit requirements

## üìã Real-World Example: Patriot Auto
