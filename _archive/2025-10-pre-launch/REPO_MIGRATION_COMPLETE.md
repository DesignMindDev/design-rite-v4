## Repository Structure (Final)

### New V4 Repo (Active) ‚úÖ
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/DesignMindDev/design-rite-v4
- **Local:** C:\Users\dkozi\Projects\design-rite-v4
- **Branches:** staging, develop, main
- **Status:** Clean history, no secrets, auth fix working

### Old V3 Repo (Inactive)
- **GitHub:** Renamed to v3 (or deleted)
- **Local:** C:\Users\dkozi\Projects\Design-Rite\v3\design-rite-v3.1\design-rite-v3
- **Status:** Can be deleted or archived

## Commit Hash Changes (Due to History Rewrite)

| Branch | Old Commit | New Commit | Description |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| staging | 38581bf | 3f3e0f4 | Auth fix + repo docs |
| staging | 62ae1a1 | dff5567 | CASCADE deletion fix |
| main/develop | e1dae2a | de6f270 | Sync branch docs |

**Why changed?** git-filter-repo rewrote history to remove secrets, creating new commit hashes.

---

## Security Status ‚úÖ

**Before Migration:**
- ‚ùå 9 files with API keys in commit history
- ‚ùå OpenAI, Anthropic, Stripe keys exposed
- ‚ùå GitHub push protection blocking deployments

**After Migration:**
- ‚úÖ All secret files removed from history
- ‚úÖ Clean commit history (492 commits processed)
- ‚úÖ No push protection blocks
- ‚úÖ Deployments working

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** If the exposed keys are still active, rotate them:
1. OpenAI API key (if still in use)
2. Anthropic API key (if still in use)
3. Stripe test API key (low risk, but good practice)

## Working Directory Setup

### Primary Workspace ‚úÖ
```
C:\Users\dkozi\Projects\design-rite-v4
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Git Remote: https://github.com/DesignMindDev/design-rite-v4.git
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Branch: staging (with working auth fix)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Status: Ready for development
```

### Claude Code Configuration
**Update working directory to:**
```
C:\Users\dkozi\Projects\design-rite-v4
```

(See FIX_CLAUDE_CODE_WORKSPACE.md for details)

## What's Next

### Immediate (Done ‚úÖ)
- [x] Clean commit history
- [x] Push to new repo
- [x] Update Render deployments
- [x] Verify builds in progress

### Optional (Later)
- [ ] Delete old confusing local clone at v3 path
- [ ] Rotate exposed API keys (if still active)
- [ ] Test staging URL after deployment completes
- [ ] Merge staging ‚Üí main when ready for production

- Building commit 3f3e0f4 from clean repo
- ETA: 2-3 minutes

**Production:** https://design-rite-v3-zk5r.onrender.com
- Building commit de6f270 from clean repo
- ETA: 2-3 minutes

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Naming Matters**: Renaming a repo creates confusion ‚Üí use fresh repo instead
2. **Multiple Clones**: Having 2 local clones caused commit/push confusion
3. **Secret Scanning**: GitHub push protection caught secrets we didn't know were exposed
4. **git-filter-repo**: Perfect tool for cleaning commit history (but rewrites hashes)
5. **Render API**: Easy to update repo connections programmatically
