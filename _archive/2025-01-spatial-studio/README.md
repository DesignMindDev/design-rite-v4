# Spatial Studio Archive
**Archived Date:** January 16, 2025
**Archived By:** Claude Code (with Dan Kozich approval)
**Reason:** Duplicate implementation - Standalone microservice now used instead

## What Was Archived

### Admin Pages
- `admin-spatial-studio/` - Original Spatial Studio admin page
- `admin-spatial-studio-dev/` - Phase 1.0 development version

### API Routes
- `api-spatial-studio/` - All 5 Spatial Studio API endpoints:
  - add-annotation/route.ts
  - analytics/route.ts
  - analyze-site/route.ts
  - process-analysis/route.ts
  - upload-floorplan/route.ts

### Components
- `components-spatial-studio/` - 3D viewer components (app/components/)
- `root-components-spatial-studio/` - Root-level components (components/)

## Why Archived

**Standalone Microservice Available:**
- Location: `C:\Users\dkozi\Projects\Design-Rite\v3\design-rite-v3.1\design-rite-spatial-studio`
- Port: 3020
- Status: Production ready (22/22 tests passing)
- Features: Async processing, comprehensive error handling, full test suite

**V4 Implementation Status:**
- Only accessible via admin panel (not public-facing)
- On back burner since Portal was created
- No active user traffic

## Replacement Strategy

Going forward, Spatial Studio will be:
1. Standalone microservice on Port 3020
2. Orchestrated via Super Agent (Port 9500)
3. Proxied through v4 API routes (when needed)

## How to Restore (If Needed)

```powershell
# From archive root
Copy-Item -Recurse "admin-spatial-studio" "../../app/admin/spatial-studio"
Copy-Item -Recurse "admin-spatial-studio-dev" "../../app/admin/spatial-studio-dev"
Copy-Item -Recurse "api-spatial-studio" "../../app/api/spatial-studio"
Copy-Item -Recurse "components-spatial-studio" "../../app/components/spatial-studio"
Copy-Item -Recurse "root-components-spatial-studio" "../../components/spatial-studio"
```

Then restore admin panel links in `/app/admin/page.tsx`
