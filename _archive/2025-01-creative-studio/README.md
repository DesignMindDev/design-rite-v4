# Creative Studio Archive
**Archived Date:** January 16, 2025
**Archived By:** Claude Code (with Dan Kozich approval)
**Reason:** Duplicate implementation - Standalone microservice now used instead

## What Was Archived

### Admin Pages
- `admin-creative-studio/` - Creative Studio admin interface

### API Routes
- `api-creative-studio/` - All 7 Creative Studio API endpoints:
  - assets/route.ts
  - designs/route.ts
  - chat/route.ts
  - generate/route.ts
  - projects/route.ts
  - publish/route.ts
  - upload/route.ts

## Why Archived

**Standalone Microservice Available:**
- Location: `C:\Users\dkozi\Design-Rite Corp\design-rite-creative-studio`
- Port: 3030
- Status: Production ready
- Features: AI-powered content generation, design creation, asset management

**V4 Implementation Status:**
- Only accessible via admin panel (not public-facing)
- On back burner since Portal was created
- No active user traffic

## Replacement Strategy

Going forward, Creative Studio will be:
1. Standalone microservice on Port 3030
2. Orchestrated via Super Agent (Port 9500)
3. Proxied through v4 API routes (when needed)

## How to Restore (If Needed)

```powershell
# From archive root
Copy-Item -Recurse "admin-creative-studio" "../../app/admin/creative-studio"
Copy-Item -Recurse "api-creative-studio" "../../app/api/creative-studio"
```

Then restore admin panel link in `/app/admin/page.tsx`
