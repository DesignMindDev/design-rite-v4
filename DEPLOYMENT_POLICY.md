# Design-Rite V4 Deployment Policy

**Last Updated:** October 18, 2025
**Status:** Pre-Production Development Phase

---

## üéØ Current Development Status

**V4 is NOT yet production-ready.** We are currently in active development and testing phase.

### Production Environment
- **URL:** https://design-rite.com (design-rite-v3-zk5r.onrender.com)
- **Branch:** `main`
- **Auto-Deploy:** ‚úÖ Enabled
- **Service ID:** `srv-d35mk4bipnbc739je85g`
- **Render Plan:** Standard

### Staging Environment
- **URL:** https://cak-end.onrender.com
- **Branch:** `staging`
- **Auto-Deploy:** ‚ùå Disabled (Manual only)
- **Service ID:** `srv-d3hvbnjuibrs73b8hvs0`
- **Render Plan:** Starter

---

## üöß Phase 1: Pre-Production Development (CURRENT PHASE)

**Goal:** Build, test, and stabilize V4 features before going live.

### Workflow

#### 1. Development on Main Branch
- All development work happens on `main` branch
- Commits automatically deploy to production environment
- This allows rapid iteration and testing

#### 2. Staging Validation (Manual)
When you want to test changes in staging:

```bash
# 1. Sync staging with main
git checkout staging
git merge main -m "Sync staging with main - [describe changes]"
git push origin staging

# 2. Manually trigger deployment via Render API
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rnd_6o7BYWraBuvow4iZbDpJov4y7gJQ" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"clearCache":"clear"}' \
  "https://api.render.com/v1/services/srv-d3hvbnjuibrs73b8hvs0/deploys"

# 3. Check deployment status
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer rnd_6o7BYWraBuvow4iZbDpJov4y7gJQ" \
  "https://api.render.com/v1/services/srv-d3hvbnjuibrs73b8hvs0/deploys?limit=1"
```

#### 3. Testing
- **Production:** Test at https://design-rite.com
- **Staging:** Test at https://cak-end.onrender.com
- Both environments should have identical code during validation

### Why Manual Staging?
- Prevents accidental staging deployments during development
- Allows controlled testing when needed
- Saves build minutes on Render
- Staging is only deployed when explicitly needed for validation

---

## üéì Phase 2: Production-Ready Workflow (FUTURE)

**When:** Once V4 is deemed stable and ready for public production use.

### Branch Strategy

```
feature-branch ‚Üí staging ‚Üí main (protected)
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì         ‚Üì
  Development    Testing   Production
```

### Workflow

#### Step 1: Feature Development
```bash
# Create feature branch from staging
git checkout staging
git pull origin staging
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make changes, commit, push
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: your feature description"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

#### Step 2: Merge to Staging
```bash
# Merge feature to staging
git checkout staging
git merge feature/your-feature-name
git push origin staging

# Manually deploy to staging
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rnd_6o7BYWraBuvow4iZbDpJov4y7gJQ" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"clearCache":"clear"}' \
  "https://api.render.com/v1/services/srv-d3hvbnjuibrs73b8hvs0/deploys"
```

#### Step 3: Staging Validation
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Test thoroughly on staging before promoting to main**

Test checklist:
- [ ] All pages load without errors
- [ ] Authentication flows work correctly
- [ ] API endpoints respond as expected
- [ ] Database operations complete successfully
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified
- [ ] Cross-browser testing complete
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

#### Step 4: Production Deployment
```bash
# ONLY after staging validation passes
git checkout main
git merge staging -m "Release: [version] - [brief description]"
git push origin main

# Production deploys automatically
# Monitor at https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d35mk4bipnbc739je85g
```

### Branch Protection Rules (To Be Enabled)

When moving to Phase 2, enable these GitHub protections on `main`:

1. **Require pull request reviews**
   - At least 1 approval required
   - Dismiss stale reviews on new commits

2. **Require status checks**
   - Build must pass
   - Linting must pass
   - Tests must pass (when test suite exists)

3. **Require branches to be up to date**
   - Must merge latest main before pushing

4. **Do not allow bypassing**
   - Even admins must follow the process

## üö® Emergency Rollback Procedure

If a bad deployment reaches production:

### Option 1: Revert via Git
```bash
# Find the last good commit
git log --oneline -10

# Revert to last good commit
git revert <bad-commit-hash>
git push origin main

# Wait for automatic deployment
```

### Option 2: Redeploy Previous Version via Render Dashboard
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d35mk4bipnbc739je85g
2. Click "Deploys" tab
3. Find last successful deploy
4. Click "Redeploy" button

### Option 3: Manual Rollback via API
```bash
# Get previous deploy ID
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer rnd_6o7BYWraBuvow4iZbDpJov4y7gJQ" \
  "https://api.render.com/v1/services/srv-d35mk4bipnbc739je85g/deploys?limit=10"

# Redeploy specific commit (replace DEPLOY_ID)
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rnd_6o7BYWraBuvow4iZbDpJov4y7gJQ" \
  "https://api.render.com/v1/services/srv-d35mk4bipnbc739je85g/deploys/DEPLOY_ID/redeploy"
```

## üí° Tips for Claude Code Sessions

**When starting a new Claude Code session:**

1. Read this `DEPLOYMENT_POLICY.md` file first
2. Check current phase (Phase 1 or Phase 2)
3. Follow the appropriate workflow
4. Never push directly to `main` in Phase 2 without staging validation
5. Always test locally before committing
6. Use descriptive commit messages
7. Sync staging manually via API when needed

**Common Commands:**
```bash
# Check what phase we're in
head -n 10 DEPLOYMENT_POLICY.md

# See recent deployments
git log --oneline -5

# Check if staging needs sync
git log main..staging
```

---

**Remember: The goal is to keep production stable while allowing rapid development. When in doubt, test in staging first!**
