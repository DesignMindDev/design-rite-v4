# Design-Rite Chat Assistant Setup

## ðŸ¤– OpenAI Assistant Configuration

To use your specific OpenAI Assistant, add these environment variables to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID=your_assistant_id_here
```

## ðŸ“‹ Assistant Instructions

Based on your files, your assistant should be configured with instructions about:

1. **Design-Rite Platform Navigation**
   - Security Estimate tool (5-minute quick estimates)
   - AI Discovery Assistant (15-20 minute comprehensive assessments)
   - AI Assistant Refinement (chat-based improvements)

2. **Security System Expertise**
   - Video surveillance systems
   - Access control solutions
   - Intrusion detection
   - Fire safety systems

3. **Pricing Intelligence**
   - Real-time CDW pricing data
   - NDAA compliance (excludes banned manufacturers)
   - Professional markup and installation costs

4. **Company Information**
   - Design-Rite mission and values

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. **Thread Management**: Each chat session gets a unique OpenAI thread
2. **Fallback System**: If OpenAI fails, falls back to pattern-matching responses
3. **Smart Routing**: Uses `/api/chat/init` and `/api/chat/message` endpoints
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with helpful error messages

2. Start chatting with your Design-Rite assistant
