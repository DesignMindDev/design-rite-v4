SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products;
SELECT * FROM admin_subscription_analytics;
```

### Step 2: Stripe Configuration
```bash
# Add to .env.local or Render environment variables:

## 💡 KEY TECHNICAL DECISIONS

### 1. Admin Subscription Panel Architecture
**Decision:** Build comprehensive dashboard with manual override capabilities
**Reason:** Sales team needs ability to extend trials, upgrade users, and manage exceptions
**Impact:** Can handle edge cases without engineering intervention

### 2. Real-Time Metrics Calculation
**Decision:** Calculate MRR, churn, LTV on-demand from subscription data
**Reason:** Simpler than maintaining aggregate tables, always accurate
**Impact:** Slight performance trade-off for accuracy (acceptable for admin-only access)

### 3. Manual vs. Automatic Action Tracking
**Decision:** Track all subscription changes with `is_automatic` flag
**Reason:** Audit trail shows which changes came from Stripe vs. admin
**Impact:** Can identify manual interventions and their reasons

### 4. Subscription Metadata Strategy
**Decision:** Store `user_id` in Stripe subscription metadata
**Reason:** Webhook handler can link Stripe events to Supabase users
**Impact:** No need for additional lookup tables

### 5. Tier Naming Update
**Decision:** Changed from base/pro/enterprise to starter/professional/enterprise
**Reason:** Match published pricing page branding
**Impact:** All code updated consistently across frontend, API, and webhooks

### 6. Supabase Auth Migration
**Decision:** Migrate from Next-Auth to Supabase Auth
**Reason:** Centralized auth system, native Supabase integration
**Impact:** Simplified auth flow, better RLS integration
